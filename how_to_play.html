        Smash is a single player game that puts your speed and accuracy skills
        into test. Your main objective in this game is to beat the time by
        tapping on the white colored tile before the time runs out. Once a tile
        is successfully tapped, you are awarded a point and if you are not able
        to smash the tile on time or you tap on a wrong tile, you lose. The
        yellow blinking tile indicates that you were not fast enough to react
        and the red blinking tile signifies that you tapped on a wrong tile. Do
        you think you have what it takes to hold the number 1 spot on the
        scoreboard? if you think so, let the game begin.
